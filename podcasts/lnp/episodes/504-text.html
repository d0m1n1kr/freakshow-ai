For this episode we made an exception and decided to record an interview in English. We are talking to Meredith Whittaker, president of the Signal Foundation, a non-profit company that's developing the Signal app that is world's most popular Multiplatform private encrypted messenger system. We talk to Meredith about her way into the digital realm, how she shook up Google by organizing walkouts and more or less erasing all memories to it's "don't be evil" motto, how Signal came to be and what its principles are, how she views Europe and the regulations policies of the EU and much much more.
