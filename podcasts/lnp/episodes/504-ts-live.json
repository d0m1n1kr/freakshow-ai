Ich habe gar keinen britischen Pass, ich bin Deutscher.","Okay, aber du hattest ja nicht einen britischen Pass.","Das ist aber abgelaufen.","Achso, der ist abgelaufen. Okay, dann das erklärt einige.","Anyway, we say hello to Meredith. Meredith Whitaker. Hello, welcome to our podcast.","I'm so happy to be here. Thank you for having me.","Meredith, you are, in case somebody doesn't know you, the president of the Signal Foundation.","I am. I am.","And Signal is a messenger application?","It is the world's most widely used, truly private messaging application.\nI always have to put the full sentence in there. A very special messaging application.","What makes it special?","Um we build against\nthe grain to put it in kind of flowery language we go out of our way to build\nfor privacy and to get as close to collecting no data at all as possible which\nas you and i assume many in your audience know is a lot more work.","Than simply encrypting.","Then well encrypting is part of that but then you need to make sure the encryption\nworks and then encryption of message content is Das ist nicht möglich,\nweil du also hast Meta-Data. Du hast auch libraries, du hast du in.\nDu hast Core Services, du hast du mit. So, da ist viel ingenuity required zu\nactually create a system das ist rejecting den normative assumptions der Tech-Industrie heute.\nWir alle wollen ein ton of Daten, und wir alle wollen monetize das Daten.\nWir wollen Sie ads mit dem Daten. Wir wollen das zu anderen Kunden.\nWir wollen das Daten-Broker. Wir wollen das AI-Modeln mit dem Daten.\nMost of the infrastructure in the tech ecosystem now assumes that as a given.\nAnd then we have to rewrite things too.","And you negate all these assumptions and try to build a truly private messaging\nplatform in a world that has a completely different business model.","Yeah. Well, I'm going to just flip that to be a little bit rhetorical and say\nthose assumptions negate the human right to private intimate communication.\nAnd we are trying to rebuild a tech ecosystem that actually honors those.","That's an even higher goal.","Yeah.","Before we dig more into the Signal project, which in itself I think is quite\ninteresting, we'd like to understand how did you get there, where you are right now.\nSo what was your introduction into this digital world? When did it start?","I don't have one of those stories where I'm like an Atari. I was four. I'm a hacker.\nI didn't care about tech, qua tech. I wasn't interested.\nYou remember back in school, there were two kinds of nerds.\nThere were the math nerds and the book nerds.","You were the book nerd?","I was the book nerd. But in the story we tell now, because nerddom has been\noverlapped with monetary success and sort of a career in math and science,\nI think we forget about the book nerds. But hello, I'm here to remind you.\nWe exist. We're here. And that's who I was.\nAnd so I studied literature and rhetoric at Berkeley, which I just thought were,\nI mean, they're still beguiling.\nLike being able to read and write is pretty fundamental for anything.\nUnd dann ich war poor so ich habe einen Job bei Google weil sie waren die ersten\nMenschen zu offeren mich ein Job und dann habe ich sehr fasziniert mit was auf\nder Erde was going on When war das?","Wenn warst du bei Google als jemand der Studierende Literatur und Rhetorik?","July 10, 2006 Ich habe mich über Berkeley und ich musste Geld und ich musste\nund ich put mein Resumé auf Monster.com which ist ein precursor zu LinkedIn,\nund ich habe mich überlegt out.\nAnd then I talked to my friend Michelangelo, because at the time you still needed\nto invite to join Gmail, as I recall.\nAnd I was like, hey, Michelangelo, can you get me an invite so I can make a\nGmail address so I can appeal to this recruiter?\nAnd now my spam-filled Gmail address dates from that moment.\nSo I was hired as something called a customer operations associate,\nand I didn't know what that was.\nNo one knows what that is. It's just a bunch of words, But it sounded,\nI was like, that's a business job. It sounds like a business title.\nI had no idea. It was basically a customer support person who wrote technical\ndocumentation, who are kind of user documentation, some technical documentation,\nand answered inquiries about Google's free products.\nAnd I was doing that for Rightly, which was an acquisition that Google made\nthat then they rebuilt to become Google Docs. Okay.\nUnd das ist an der Zeit, die ganze Zeit, die Google-Businessen war, was nur Search.\nSo Search war all auf der Main Campus. Es war wo die Money kam,\nund dann war das Dinky-little-Building, wo alles, Gmail, Blogger, Rightly, Reader,\nall of them sat und sie waren experimental projects. Und das war called Apps.","Did you ever have exposure to actual customers or did you just write documentation?","Well, they would email in. I only did this for a second because I kind of figured\nout I wanted to do other things. And that's part of the story.\nThere's a part of the story, actually. So I did answer inquiries sometimes.\nAnd there were auto responses, like hotkeys you'd use in this really janky ticketing system.\nAnd this is back. We didn't have laptops. There's no such thing as a smartphone.\nOur desktops were chained to the desk. Und wenn du nach Hause bist,\nwenn du nach Hause bist, wenn du nach Hause bist, dann musst du nachdenken.\nDu hast du nachdenken, das klunky Lenovo oder so.\nIch weiß nicht genau, aber es war...\nIch war mir, okay, ich werde rewarded in meinem Job, based auf wie viele Tickets ich close bin.\nAber ich weiß nicht die Engenheer, die haben zu close diese Tickets,\nweil ich mich reporting bugs, und ich muss sie fix.\nUnd wenn sie nicht fix die Bugs sind, dann bin ich nicht rewarded.\nUnd ich war mir, das ist wirklich silly.\nSo ich war über die Apps-Büte, weil ich in einer anderen Bühne bin bin.\nUnd ich mit der engineering team und ich war, hey, ich bin das Person,\ndie gibt es diese E-Mails, die Sie anwenden Sie.\nUnd ich war able, zu convince einem einen zu gehen, zu Costco,\ndie ist dieses große Warehouse-Store, ein Walmart-E-Store in den USA,\nund put ein giantes Kuchen auf seine eigene Karte, und bring es in den Apps-Bilden,\nso ich konnte sit mit dem.\nWeil wenn ich mit dem satte, dann könnte ich mit dem, und dann würde ich mich\nmehr möglich zu fixen, meine Bugs.\nUnd so all my bugs started getting fixed but then my manager got really,\nupset because it was like obviously I had breached the hierarchy and I was like\nand so this meeting appeared on my calendar that was basically about me being\ninsubordinate but I'm also like I didn't come from that class I had no I was\nlike what the fuck did I do wrong I don't know,\nand I was like oh god I like I did something and then.\nThe day before I think that meeting was going to happen, this email hit,\nwe had this all, like some group, I don't know, it was like the group to the\nconsumer operations team.\nAnd one of the engineering directors in Apps must have had like a beer or something\nduring one of the many, many, many drinking parties that happened during the\nday at Google in that era.\nAnd sent some email that was like, Meredith, this couch is a model for collaboration.","I was going to say, that's why you hired somebody from Berkeley.\nTo write your tickets because they come up with ideas like that.","And then that meeting just disappeared and I was like, well shit,\nI need another job because I just burned someone who's going to figure out how\nto get back at me and that's where my street sense comes in.\nSo I took a bike around campus for a couple months and asked every VP during\ntheir office hours, which is a thing they used to have like, hey, I want another job.\nAnd I would just drop in and be like, hi, you don't know me. I'd like a job.\nAnd then I got a job doing basically Standards work, like trying to push document interop standards.\nAnd so I started in standards and then standards parlays into measurement pretty\nquickly because measurement is ultimately the methodological standard.\nAnd co-founded MLab and then that became the nucleus around which the research\ngroup I founded existed and then that was the...\nThat was when the fresh air of sort of these political and social complexities\nstarted hitting my technical work. And I was like, oh, standardization is power.\nOh, creating data means you own the narrative. Oh, shit, none of this is neutral.\nAll of this is contingent.\nI started seeing the balance sheet. I started seeing the capital that was involved\nin running infrastructure.\nAnd I remember around the time I met you, Linus, like maybe over a decade ago.","Yeah, it must have been about a decade or longer. Yeah, probably a bit longer even.","Yeah, aging is weird.\nAber ich habe diese schluss-Ballanz-Ballanz-Sheets. Ich habe aus Google gepritten,\ndie gezeigt, wie viel die Uplink-Bandwidth und die Infrastruktur und Power-Costs für MLAB war.\nUnd ich würde das zeigen, das zu all diese Civil Society funders,\nwie gesagt, Sie können 250k verdienen.\nEs kostet 40 Millionen a Jahr in Bandwidth, nur zu MLAB.\nDu wirst nicht verstehen, die economics of this, denn wir sind in der Era der\nCivic-Technik, All we need is a good idea, right?\nAnd I think I was really lucky to get sensitized to the political economy and\nthe fact that we're talking about infrastructure,\ncapital, network effects, economies of scale and not some kind of brilliant\nidea that just ephemerally transformed our world,\nand that our side just needs to wait to have one of those to get our turn.","That sounds like a quick upgrade from a customer support person.\nYeah, yeah, yeah. So, you mentioned MLab, which stands for Measurement Lab.","It does, yeah.","Can you explain what this is all about and how it came alive and why you were involved?","Yeah. It was a project that was Derek Slater, Vince Cerf, Stephen Stewart,\nSasha Meinrath at Open Tech Institute.","The elders of the internet.","Yeah, some old internet guys and me.","Let's say the elders of the internet.","You're one of them now.","And the lady with the couch. And the conceit there, which felt really simple\nto me at the time, is everyone is buzzing about net neutrality.\nAnd I was a Kool-Aid drinker. I still think the value underlying that kind of\nmythology, let's say, like, yes, we should not have one gatekeeper deciding\nwhich news source, right? This is old school common sense.\nIt goes back to Western Union, who there's a little, you know,\nin the US would refuse to carry telegrams from political candidates the company didn't support, right?\nSo there's a real bedrock precedent here.\nAnd I was like, yeah, of course we need net neutrality.\nNeutrality itself is a really wafty, it's a loose concept.\nIt needs to be augured in some type of benchmark against which we can assess is this neutral or not.","You need to quantify it.","Yes. And then you just flung into the abyss of philosophy the second you try to do that.\nBut we started and I would say it was not necessarily built to succeed.\nIt was built as a sort of hypothesis project where\nwe stood up three servers that hosted\nopen source measurement clients and the thing\nthat we were doing was putting servers that were all configured the same that\ngave each client a dedicated slice of resources and then way over-provisioned\nthe uplink between the server and the switch so that we could all,\nfor all intents and purposes, guarantee that any artifacts that were detected\nthrough the measurement methodology like some TCP,\nRTT or something, were not interfered with by our infrastructure and weren't\nsuffering for bandwidth.","So for practical reasons you had unlimited bandwidth and zero latency to everywhere.","Yeah, and let's, you know, and that's very expensive. But then,\nwe immediately DDoS the servers or like, oh shoot, because Vint's put a blog\npost out and he was you know he's a big name,\nand then it was like this job of years and years of getting servers in different\ninterconnection points because we wanted to measure across consumer you know\nwe're not just measuring to a server in the network exactly and we need to cross\ninterconnection points to do that because that's where you begin to see interesting\nbusiness relationships and kind of feuds,\nand it was just it was very it taught me about like how difficult and contingent and,\nultimately subjective, creating data is, and the political process of then sort\nof defending that data as a reliable proxy for reality.\nBecause I would be at the Federal Communications Commission and I had Comcast\nacross from me being like, no, we want to measure it multi-threaded TCP versus\nsingle-threaded because you get a, let's just say, higher number that way.\nIt's more forgiving. and we would be sort of defending the methodology of our\ntests and the openness principles.\nSo it was open source code, the database architecture was open.\nI don't remember all the server architecture, it was old school,\nold school ideological.","You really don't sound like a book nerd now. You've become a real network nerd.","Let's just say book nerds read and network stuff is written down.\nI read the fucking menu of it. I'm like, no one told me I was allowed to not\nread it and still have an opinion.","I love networking.","It taught me everything about so much because you get down to the network layer\nand you're like, fuck, everything is broken. It's all tied together with string.\nWhat's going on? Okay, so your promises in the pitch meeting are guaranteed by this.\nThis crusty old library that's maintained by a guy on a boat with a BitLocker\naccount. Like, what is going on?","It's scary, isn't it?","It is. I mean, it's a catalyst into today for my work.","You did that for, I think, a couple of years, the MLab stuff.\nAnd you also, at this point in time, I think, began, you know, the ties to the,\nLet's say broader internet freedom community. I remember Uniprobe at the time, I think, was another.\nThey still exist, right? They do.","And we actually talked to them at Signal. They'll detect signal blocking.\nAnd I believe, so one of the things MLab did was provide backend infrastructure\nfor projects like Uniprobe.\nAnd I don't actually know what that relationship is today.\nSo academics and hackers and developers could write a test or kind of a measurement\nmethodology deploy a client,\nto consumers like you test from your laptop or whatever and then we would be\nthe ones paying for the bandwidth and infrastructure that would allow that to scale Uni.","Is the Open Observatory of Network Interference.","If I remember the acronym Hi Arturo So...","Disclosing a whole social network here voluntarily. So, but eventually something\nhappened that is known as the Google Walkouts.\nWas that following your MLab activities or during your MLab activities or did\nyou rise even higher in the Google hierarchies before that happened?","Well, I mean, there are many. I think, so...\nI was not working on MLAB by that point.\nMLAB, there's a part of this story that I didn't cover, which is around,\nI don't know, 2014, 2015,\nwe started seeing really interesting artifacts in the data,\nwhich showed essentially that at particular interconnection points between particular\ntelcos, we were seeing drastic drops in performance.\nAnd what we were able to do was look at, you know, every intersection of Telco\n1 and Telco 2, we see this drop.\nIntersections of Telco 3 and Telco 2 don't see this drop.\nAnd so what we're able to do is say, like, there's actually a business feud\ngoing on. And the interconnection point is the locus of that feud.\nAnd using traceroute data, we were able to say, like, look, these aren't,\nit's not just that they're sharing a path in some other region of the network that's slowing it down.","They're actively throttling.","They're actively throttling. And we put together a report on that.\nAnd this is where I was sort of, I think, kind of sideloading myself into some\nacademic research work. I was like, okay, how do we do this?\nDocument our methodology. Document sort of everything was open.\nSo we pulled that together.\nAnd it showed, I don't know if you remember, there was a sort of Comcast Cogent Netflix.","Oh, yeah.","Netflix was shoving all its traffic through Cogent. What we had done is expose\nthat and exposing that it exposed the principle that you have to if you wanted\nto ensure net neutrality, you have to take the interconnection points and the\ninterconnection agreements into account.\nAnd that led Obama to add interconnection to the reclassification under Title\nII of these, you know, which kind of moved toward net neutrality that was nullified.\nBut, you know, that was kind of the swan song, let's say, for my MLab time,\nbecause, of course, that was a huge deal, right?\nLike, that's where the business model rubber hits the road.\nAnd, you know, I'll just shorthand it. Like, that bought me a lot of capital at Google.\nAnd with that, I was, you know, I was already interested in a lot of things.\nMLab was sort of humming along and, like, it had grown from a hypothesis project\nto, like, a global thing that was working and doing stuff.\nAnd I started getting agitated by AI and a lot of these privacy and security\nconcerns, being part of the community that you were part of,\nyou know, kind of thinking around like\ntech alternatives and getting less comfortable with the business model.\nAnd from there I always had like eight different projects going on but I went\non to found, to co-found the AI Now Institute which was really trying to bring the conversation,\non what we called machine learning back then but like AI was like a flashier\nterm, like bring it down to the ground a little bit and stop talking about superintelligence\nand stop talking about, you know,\nPolitical economy, what are these technologies, how are they being deployed,\nhow do you oversee them, who uses them on whom, and what are the social and\npolitical dynamics of that.","But the AI Now Institute is not hosted at Google, is it? No.\nWhich university is it again?","It was at NYU, and it's moved out of NYU for reasons of that being easier.","Okay.","And cheaper, because they take like 40%, those universities.","Okay.","Word to the wise, your money.","What do you think?","Like whatever donations you get. Okay.","Yeah. So it's an expensive brand.","Well, for a reason, right? I mean, NYU Institute, that's something to have, I think, co-founded.","Co-founded, yeah. I mean, the work was really good. And this was,\nagain, gaining the capital at Google, cementing a reputation,\nbeing able to get to a level where I had a budget.\nAnd then part of what I was always trying to do is how much can I pull out of\nGoogle and get into the hands of people doing work that I think is cool.\nHow do we carve tributaries in the massive river of this huge,\nrich company and get it out?","So you started that institute at the end of 2017.","Well, beginnings are sometimes hard to date.\nIt was born out of a request from the Obama administration to be the host of one of his AI summits.\nI don't remember exactly the contours there, but it was in 2016.\nAnd so it started as like, like the idea then was like, let's do this and let's do it big.\nLike, let's make this the most polished, flashiest, like hard to ignore kind\nof spectacle using all the tools we can get from like hiring an events agency,\ndoing good press, all of that.\nBut let's also make this the one that is the most engaged with these political topics,\nthat's actually forcing the debate in that direction and kind of making it face\nthese questions that are much more grounded and, you know,\nhopefully much more healthy for our population.\nSo it was very successful and from there we got offers of funding and a lot\nof encouragement and the work just kept going.","Well, we in Europe, we are used to be a bit behind, but if I can recall 2016,\nthere was no discussion about AI in Europe at all.\nAnd so, it's quite interesting to see that Obama has actually,\nyou know, decided that it's finally time to do something about this topic nobody\nhas ever really talked about.","Germans are currently making up their mind whether that is a topic.","Ja, wir sprechen viel über Europa heute.\nAber mein Frage ist, kann man describe was kind of discussions going on 10 Jahre\nago in American society that this has come up to be something of a topic for the near future,\nwhich actually became a big one.\nWhere did this discussion take place?","Yeah, to answer this question, I'm going to be drawing on a lot of the research\nand the historical work, the work I've done since then.\nBecause when this dawned in my life, when it started being a thing,\nI had basically that same question. What is this stuff?\nWhy is it kind of... At Google, you would see...\nA shift toward a new paradigm or a new trend by the incentives that were structured\ninto the OKRs, the quarterly goals,\nthat kind of, you know, there'd be all these training modules that would pop\nup and it's like make your software engineer into an AI developer,\nyou know, and you'd be like, there's an incentive here.","Seems like they weren't too successful though, right? I mean,\nthat's not like the biggest AI wave at Google.","Well, they were, that was DeepMind era. So, okay, okay, good.","Sorry.","I think they were ahead. It was them and Meta for a long time. And the history...","Didn't make it to the business though at the time, right?","No, but they're chaotic. It's a kind of court in decline. So that,\nyou know, actually where the... Actually the business model part has never been\ntheir strong suit beyond search.\nTo be real, you know, like cloud is like the best technology presented confusingly\nwith 18 versions all deprecated, right? Like that's... Um,\num, but this, the, the AI stuff was, so if you look at the, if you look at the\nsort of recent history, which is something I'm spending, I've spent a lot of time on.\nI spend a lot of time on because I think we, you know, that gives us a really\ndifferent picture than the Elon Musk narrative or the kind of popular narrative.\nThere's a very important paper that was published in 2012 that introduced the\nAlexNet algorithm. und das war Jeff Hinton und his students, you may recognize.","Who just got the Nobel Prize. Physics, interestingly enough.","Yeah, because there is no AI.","Yeah, because there is no computer Nobel Prize.","Well, if you claim that your technology is everything, then you can get a prize in anything.","Which is a proven point now, yeah.","And it was Ilya Stutzkever and then Alex. I'm sorry, Alex, I'm not grabbing\nyour last name from the ether right now.\nBut nonetheless, this was a paper that kind of pulled together key ingredients\nthat became the foundation of the AI boom now.\nSo this is deep learning algorithms, which is the paradigm we're still in.\nIt doesn't matter. There's architectural sort of rejiggering,\nbut nonetheless, it's deep learning.\nHuge amounts of data. So what I've called the derivatives of the surveillance business model.","He found all the cats on YouTube.","I mean, yeah, that was Jeff Dean, I think.\nAnd then, you know, powerful compute, right?\nAnd they showed that sort of using gaming chips and a lot of data,\nyou could beat the benchmark.\nSo score much better against standard evaluations than past models and thus\nsort of catalyzed the industrial industry interest in AI and why were they interested?\nI think this is a key point because these optimist-seeking algorithms are really\ngood at curating news feeds.\nThey're really good at figuring out algorithms, right?\nI don't think it's an accident that Jeff was immediately hired,\ndass Jan LeCun, die die deep-learning-Algorithmen, die das Seed der Moment in\nAI in den 80ern, in den letzten 80ern, war er mit Meta.\nUnd es war die Plattform-Companien mit der realen Investition in squeezing mehr\nAd-Dollars aus der Daten, better-serving, all of das.\nDas ist Google mit DeepMind. Du sehen Meta und Google die leaders in das.\nAls measured by different evaluation standards, the measurement question hier\nist eigentlich wirklich interesting und troubling.\nUntil this generative moment where I think the ChatGPT Microsoft products shifted\npeople's perception of AI and what it can do and just rearrange the leaderboard.\nBut the paradigm is still the same And the paradigm is still that AI is applying\nold algorithms on top of the sort of massive platform monopoly business model,\navailing itself of huge amounts of data, which is produced via this surveillance\nbusiness model, and really powerful compute that was designed,\nbuilt up, you know, I would say, like, consolidated in the hands of these platform\ncompanies via the imperatives of the surveillance business model, right?","Would you say that, so clearly, I mean, you say,\nso here are Google and Meta that have these massive amounts of data,\nlike larger amounts of data than probably ever existed or were in the hands\nof anybody or any organization.\nWould you say that they had amassed all this data and eventually learned,\nokay, we probably can't handle this anymore, so we're interested in this new\nparadigm to even monetize this data any further?\nOr was it rather like, oh, we have all this data, we're monetizing it well,\nhere's another way to monetize it on top of that. because clearly these deep\nlearning algorithms are not of much use if you don't have large data.","Set and large compute for both training and inference but is.","It the hen egg what's the hen what's the egg there.","I think this\nis almost a perpetual motion machine right like\nevery quarter you have to report progress you have to report growth the logic\nis metastasis and so you know you're trying to squeeze more out of what you\nhave and you're trying to get more of what you have so you can squeeze more\nright there's also these sort of laws of scale remember big data we used to call it that,\nand so I don't I don't actually know the answer to your question but I think it,\nWhich came first? But, well, I mean, the business model came first, right?\nYou had to have the ingredients to know what they did together.\nAnd I think it was deep learning and AI had sort of languished in the backwater\nwith some interesting experiments through the 2000s because its history is always\npromising too much and disappointing since the mid-50s when it was invented.\nAnd I think the goal was really to sort of supercharge their existing business model.","I think deep learning was just the technology that perfectly served their current\nbeliefs in that they have to work on the data,\nthat they have to build up algorithms to somehow predict your personal future\nand be there with an ad before you even know it and we've seen this,\nas an ad everywhere and we've also seen it in political influence as we've seen in the Brexit,\ndecision and also in the elections where we heard there's going to be one in\nthe near future as well in the US that might be influenced as well.","Let me check my calendar.\nI mean I think we can like peel back also just this concept of like what is\nan advertisement right? It's an influence.\nIs it trying to get you to buy something? Is it trying to get you to like something?\nIs it trying to get you to believe something? Is it trying to get you to vote a certain way?\nAnd I think that the term advertisement is usefully deconstructed when we start\nto think about the connection between all of those.","The term advertising is one of the best tricks the devil ever pulled.\nBecause it's behavior manipulation. It's a stated goal. But I remember when.\nThe first debates came up about, for example, the Cambridge Analytica scan.\nIt's like, they used Facebook data to manipulate voters.\nAnd it's like, no, there's a red line over here. You can't manipulate behavior.\nI mean, Facebook and Google were basically built to manipulate users' behavior\nand ideally capture their attention to change their behavior.\nWir haben wahrscheinlich dieses shirt oder das oder das oder das oder das oder\ndas oder das oder das oder das oder das oder das oder das oder das oder das oder das ist.\nWie können wir das so etwas machen? Das ist unheard of.\nSo viewing advertising as like, oh, this is just an offer.\nThis is, oh, we're just making our product. No, no, I have a limited amount of attention per day.\nYou're capturing it and you're doing it with one simple reason.\nAnd that is changing my behavior in the sense that you aim for.\nAnd I guess eventually it sounds like,\neventually you questioned your Google career, right? Because you were,\nI mean, clearly you had an impressive career there in just a few years.\nUm, but you began to question not only your, like Google and the company culture,\nbut apparently also a little bit your,\nyour, the way you want to continue with your, with your, you know,\nmaking use of the influence and the knowledge you have.","Yeah. I think.","Is that the walkouts?","I mean, it's all interlinked and kind of periodizing your own consciousness is hard.\nBut I think I'm pretty earnest and I also don't come from that world,\nI don't come from that class so there are often places where I just didn't,\nyou know, I would take things sincerely or be like really committed and then only realize like\ntwo thirds of the way through whatever it was like oh no one else really cares\nabout this they're just networking or you know whatever it was so I think there\nwas an element there where like you know when I was doing MLab I was like I\nreally want to win net neutrality Und dann we won net neutrality.\nAber dann ist das, dass ich das nicht der Fall war.\nGoogle hat eine größere Netzwerke als Comcast. Das ist nicht die Gatekeeper.\nAber das war eine Sincere Sache.\nUnd dann war ich, okay, ich kann mich,\num, Geld zu all diese coolen Privatsch-Hacker-Projekte. Das war Sincere.\nUnd dann wurde ich in AI und ich war, okay, und ich denke, das ist etwas,\ndas hat sich verändert für mich.\nI think I used to have a lot, lot more faith in the power of ideas to influence real change, right?\nAnd I still think, you know, I spend a lot of time in kind of thinking through\ndiscourses, how do we shape them?\nLike, how do we kindly walk people into understanding things that,\nyou know, they may have an interest in not understanding or they may have been,\nyou know, misinformed about or what have you.\nBut I began you know I began around the time I was looking at AI and sort of making all these cases,\nthat everyone loved right like I was out there giving talks that were completely\nagainst the Google party line and I was getting like applauses,\nI was getting promoted like I was like this is a this is a perfect job.\nAnd then you know like I was I envied you not only once I'm the house troll,\nbut then there was I was getting more influence so I was becoming known outside\nand inside I was like the person you'd call into your team when it was like\noh we want to implement this is there an ethical way to do it,\nand you would say no I would, I would be like my dear friends let us sit down,\nand then I was getting, I don't know, that was sort of my life and we kind of\ntook the AI Now Institute and really did a lot to reshape the debate.\nI was very focused on that discursive intervention and how do we begin to talk\nabout AI in a more realistic way and that was working outside of Google but\nit wasn't really influencing core decisions at Google and that was kind of the\nthing I kept hitting up against more and more strongly until I got a signal message in...\nLate 2017.","From Moxie?","No, I mean, I probably did get one from Moxie at that time, but this one was not that one.\nIt was from a friend of mine at Google who said, yo, there's a really disturbing\nproject that is hidden that I'm very close to.\nAnd you should know about it because you're the AI person who cares about this\nand you have standing at the company around it.\nAnd this was the secretive contract that Google signed with the Department of\nDefense to build AI drone targeting and surveillance systems for the drone war.\nAnd of course, like I was politicized post 9-11, post Snowden.\nLike this was, you know, the drone war and the signature strike and all of that\nwere really core in kind of my, you know, things that I ideologically rejected\nand, you know, felt like we needed to disarm, not supercharge.\nAnd I had like a, you know, like a righteous anger. I was just like, fuck this.","Because you're there running around, you know, trying to shape the discourse on AI.","And making them look good, right? Because they get to be like,\nlook, we platform such heterodox voices. We're surely benevolent, right?\nAnd then I'm like, okay, and then you're inking this deal with the DoD behind\nthe scenes for technology that one we know doesn't sort of work for the purpose, right?\nLike, you know, it's not going to better identify a worthy\ntarget of death oder whatever the fuck it's you know it's not you\nknow we know this is bullshit but like and you\nknow this is a multinational company like more than\nhalf the employees are outside the US there is an issue with yoking yourself\nto you know not that you have one nation's government not that many tech companies\ncare that much about that and then there was just the you know what is the structural\ndanger which is deeply acute and,\nof a massive surveillance company with more data than the world has ever seen,\nmore compromised than you can imagine, like yoking their fortunes and a key\ndependency to the US military, right?\nAnd, you know, we know from Snowden that that's already like,\nyou know, seen as, you know, as long as it's a corporation gathering it, it's not, you know.","Was Google still running under the motto of don't be evil at the time?","They were, they were. And that was, we marshaled that actually.","Kind of like the end of it, wasn't it?","They quietly, like the lawyers removed that from the Google Manifesto.\nIt was slowly fading. Yeah, it was like, they were like, just don't open that closet.","Which motto? I don't recall any. It's like, do you know something about this?","Try not to be bad is the new motto.","Don't be as bad as that.","Yeah, like lay off the evil.\nJa, so I mean, and this was, there were like a lot of old school people there\nat that time who really did drink the Kool-Aid and so it was you know,\nI just put my energy into organizing against that and that was when I turned\ntoward labor organizing and thinking through traditional,\nmethods and approaches to combating that type of corporate power or you know\nindustrial power and we, you know, and that That was the on-ramp to the walkout.\nSo the walkout was like a big, that was like a rupture, like a manifestation.\nIt got a lot of press and it was the biggest labor action in tech.","So just to make that clear, the walkouts were actually people walking outside\nof the Google buildings for, I don't know, how long?","I think it was November 11th, 2018.\nUnd everyone walked out for 20 minutes at 11.11am in their local time so we\ncalled it Rolling Thunder and it started in the Singapore office as I was going\nto bed in New York and I was seeing the photos,\nand this was chaos I hadn't slept in days there's so many meetings there's so\nmany tears it's hard to organize something like that,\nand I remember going to bed and seeing the images from Singapore mit ein paar\nhundert Leuten in Singapur und ich war,\ndas ist großartig.\nUnd dann habe ich New York time gewohnt, um 5 a.m. zu gehen in New York zu unserer\nlocation und prepen es, um, dass wir uns da sind.\nAnd then I just remember seeing, like, there was this little park near the New\nYork office, and then it just, like, grew outside the park.\nAnd then no one could get into the park. And then I was looking at my home,\nand there's my phone, and there's live helicopter feeds.\nAnd we don't have bullhorns, because I'm one of the speakers.\nThere's, like, speakers standing on chairs to address the crowd.\nAnd then this guy, like, some, you know, there's this sort of type.\nI don't know if in Germany you have this type, but they're, like,\nkind of, like, the leftist at every protest.\nAnd like some guy had like found out about it and came in and I just remember this like,\nlike this man I'd never seen like handing me a bullhound from below and I picked\nit up and like we were like bullhound like a megaphone like a megaphone yeah yeah yeah.\nAnd then it was you know and then we walked over\nto a Mexican restaurant and sat at the table and had a press operation\nwhere like that we were running and what was cool was like everyone organizing\nthat was kind of a professional most of them were femme and most of them had\njobs at Google that were like organizing the company so organizing their comms\nbeing an administrator for like 13 different directors,\nthis particular type of hyper competence at coordinating activity across a number\nof people who you may not have direct power over and like for that much more.","Than developers in that.","Respect I mean let's just say Yeah, yes. You know, you can, like somebody who\ncan write an email and get someone to respond to that email by doing a thing is kind of a witch.\nAnd it was all these like these preternaturally competent femmes just turning\nthat energy toward organizing across the company,\nwhich was building on this sort of base of meetings and locals and all of this\nsort of work that we'd done to kind of form a discursive environment inside\nGoogle where we're like weekly meetings to discuss the news,\nwhat Google could do, what campaigns we could do.\nSo we had this sort of energy and solidarity already at that point.","How many percent of the Google employees would you say have at one point taken part in this?","I don't know. we were really careful\nnot to keep lists yeah I mean you can dream up a number now you know I.\n20,000 was the number estimated from the Sky Photos and the local reports.\nWe had local leads at every office.\nWe sent them zip files of the kit for handing out the flyers,\nthe talking points, how to treat media, all of that.\nThey all had that, and then they organized their local. And then they had reporting\nback in from press, reporting back into the central organizers around numbers.\nAnd then we were issuing the press releases. um but\nthen you know there's employees of google and\nthen there's contractors of google which more than double employees so\nit you know that number is and and then there's people who\ncouldn't participate but were really supportive because they\nhave you know need their health insurance or they'll die or they are on a visa\nand so it wasn't um i think there was a huge amount of support uh i know that\nwe were able to get google to drop their military contract because there was\nenough support and there was you know there was like a spreadsheet of people who are quitting,\nconscientious objectors we had you know like every week at the all-town meeting\nthere was a table we would set up with like banners and something like we would\nhad questions like it was a very,\nit was a very like rigorous campaign and it kind of laid the laid the groundwork\nand i think it built some muscle that people are probably almost are definitely\nusing now even if they don't call at organizing.\nIt's like, how do we marshal the resources from this?","So did Google then still love you at that point?","Well, I think Google does still love me, but it doesn't love itself enough to admit it.","They have issues, I think.","I do think that. Come on, come on. Which side do you want to be on?\nWhich party do you want to go to? Let's be real.","I mean, it leads to an interesting point because I would say,\nlooking from the other side of the ocean, I think to us, this whole tech scene,\nThe startups, the new stuff, the internet, everything that has developed in\nthe last 20 years or so, always had this liberal touch to it.\nIt felt as if it was mostly about an open, world-loving agenda and it's good for everybody.\nAnd Google kind of tuned in with their motto and some other companies did as well, some not so much.\nBut it was always this feeling that liberal thinking is at the core of everything\nthat is driving the internet forward.\nAnd I think we stopped thinking that now because it looks totally different right now.\nCurrently, we have more the feeling that it's turned into a total right-wing apocalypse somehow.\nAnd I haven't really seen this coming.\nCan you explain what happened to this tech scene? What happened?","I, well, you know, I think about post 9-11 and a lot of the fights over surveillance and tech.\nAnd there's a talk that, who was, Frank Rieger and Rupert Gronkripp?","Rob Gronkripp, Rob Gronkripp.","Sorry, I don't, that's my American, you'll do beautifully in America.","It's complicated for us.","Ja, aber ich entschuldige für nicht das richtig.","Roppenfrank.","Ja, ich habe diese Talk, We Lost the War, ich glaube es war 1994. Nein, 2004.","Ja.","Ich habe die gleiche Sache gemacht.\nUnd nicht jeder, ich glaube, war equating die growth und monetary success of\nthe US-based tech industry with sort of, you know, values of social progress.\nI mean, I think we can, yeah, yes, it was liberal and then we can get back to\na critique of liberalism and what have you, but it was, I think there were people\nwho were looking at the infrastructure,\nwho were looking at its capabilities, who were looking at the gap between the\npromises and the reality of what this tech did and calling that out.\nAnd I feel like, you know, when I entered into this kind of,\nPrivacy, security, hacker development scene.\nThere was a lot of that skepticism there around Google.\nThat educated me a lot. There was a lot of skepticism around surveillance.\nI immediately recognized, yes, we need privacy because it doesn't matter if\nthese people are good or benevolent.\nWhat we're doing is setting up an infrastructure that could be turned over at\nany moment to another regime. Logically, all of that made sense.\nBut I don't feel that until the Snowden revelations, any of that was anywhere\nnear in the nervous system of a kind of tech consciousness.\nAnd a lot of the work I've spent in the 1990s trying to sift through the crypto\nwars and sift through what happened with tech regulation to set up these surveillance\ngiants and to permit this monopoly platform business model,\nhas kind of looked at that gap between the rhetoric of liberal rights preserving.\nOpen, free tech, and what was actually being built, right?\nAnd one of the things, if you look at, there's a scholar named Katharina Ryder,\nwho I would really suggest, for show notes, I can send some of these links.\nBut she did her dissertation looking at some of the negotiations in the crypto wars.\nAnd what you begin to see is that, yeah, we, you know, and this is a thesis\nsort of I build on top of in some of my work.\nYeah, we won liberalized encryption, right?\nBy 1999 in the US, it was finally legal to build, share, implement strong cryptosystems\nwithout approval from the government, without some threshold that made them useless.\nBut the agreement there was basically, yeah, you can have encryption,\nbut we're going to permit mass surveillance by companies.\nUnd so you don't actually, like, you can just get the, you know,\nwe're going to permit, we're going to endorse the advertising business model.\nWe're going to endorse, and I can actually, I can start this point over, actually.","Would you say those two decisions were...\nStrategically interlinked or were they just coinciding?","I can't say that there was a conspiracy. What I can say is that Katarina's work\nshows that Microsoft saying liberalize encryption, don't worry we're not going\nto encrypt all the data, we need it.\nJust come to us quietly and we'll give it to you.\nInstead of fighting over a backdoor, instead of doing this in sort of the public\ndomain where we're kind of losing the fight on technical and other grounds.\nAllow companies free reign to surveil because that allows us to implement this\nad-supported business model.\nAnd then the data agreements can happen behind the scene.\nNow, I've like completely compressed a very complex history into basically a meme.\nBut I think the purpose is there is that there was always that gap between these\nsort of rhetoric and what was actually going on.\nAnd I think the, I don't know, like there's like a kind of internet people, right?\nThis type maybe misunderstood exactly like how this, you know,\nwho would have power over this technology, right?\nLike encryption is liberalized, but it's not gonna be applied to protect personal\ncommunication. It's applied to protect transactions, right?\nIt's not, you know, like the people who get to choose whether or not it's used aren't us.\nIn terms of, you know, actually this sort of mass infrastructure in terms of\nthe tech ecosystem that's being built by the actors who are calibrating their\ndecisions based on the surveillance business model that has been instantiated right,\nyou know, through regulatory decisions made by the Clinton administration.","So then there were a couple of hundreds of thousands of nerds worldwide that used PGP encryption,\nusing additional software and plugins to send an email with nonsense information\nto avoid government or private sector surveillance.\nBut it was probably never really a significant number of individuals that...\nThat got to the point of, you know, having mass encryption out there.","Yeah, well, I tried. It's just that my friend group didn't overlap exactly with\nthose couple of thousand nerds. So what am I going to do, right?\nAnd I think that's, you know, this is the network effect. This is why it's actually\nvery difficult to do that.\nAnd this is why if one of those actors that controls these infrastructures doesn't\nmake the choice for us, it's really difficult to make that choice.","And none of these actors voluntarily got the idea, right? I think it's part\nof the founding myth of Signal that Moxie at the time wanted to implement the,\nit's now called the Signal Protocol.\nI still remember it as being Axolotl or whatever it was called.","It used to be Axolotl. And then it was when Signal was launched,\nwhich was the Red Phone Tech Secure integrated into one app for iOS in 2013. It was changed.","Right. But initially, I believe Moxie wanted to implement at Crypto for Twitter,\ndirect messages, if I'm not mistaken. I think it was at Twitter before.\nAnd so his idea to roll out Twitter,\nDefinitely, he devoted a few years of his life to implementing and rolling out\nmass end-to-end encryption, right?\nBut I believe it was he wanted to do it at Twitter at the time.\nAnd maybe I'm wrong here, then our listeners will correct me two minutes into the show.\nBut clearly, none of the large...","And I don't actually know for sure that story, so don't correct me.","It's my mistake.","Ich habe einen anderen Punkt, aber ich denke, dass Twitter nicht sich als eine\nMessergebung und eine Messergebung und eine Messergebung was,\nwas wahrscheinlich ein Mistake von der Ich meine.","Und der Regulatory Issues. Ja. Ich meine, ich habe mich mit der Security Team\nund da waren immer diese Ideen,\nich habe immer ein Projekt wo wir uns an die Keystore für andere Services und\ndu hast diese wirklich exciting conversations mit den Security Guys and then\nit wouldn't go anywhere because then, you know, the other guys would get involved.","Point I was trying to make is none of the big platforms ever rolled out mass\nscale end-to-end encryption until eventually WhatsApp did.\nAnd it took an Edward Snowden revelations and an ongoing scanner for I think\nroughly one year until Facebook at the time said, okay, we'll implement this.","Well, actually, I mean, that's, So Signal existed before the WhatsApp integration.","Sure.","And the WhatsApp integration was driven by Brian and Jan, who are the co-founders.\nAnd my understanding there is that they were rushing to get that done before\nthe Facebook integration, to make sure that they weren't selling something that\nwould violate their principles.\nAnd I know Moxie was working on that. I remember that period of time.\nUnd dann Facebook bought it.\nUnd ich weiß nicht, dass die deal da ist, aber es bleibt, mit der Signals-Protokolle.\nEs war ein Post-Snowden Moment.\nDu sahst Android und iOS implementiert Full Disk Encryption.\nDu sahst Google encrypting. its.\nHTPS for its networks and I think a lot of this was just like we need to distance\nourselves from bad government spying by adding encryption that proves that we're\nnot actually part of the problem that they have just sort of,\nthe bad government has attacked us as taxpaying corporations,\ntaken this data that we really want to protect but god how could we have known\nand so now we're encrypting things and,\nultimately good, right? But it was a way of not looking at the full story of\nlike, why is that there to begin with?\nAnd what else is not being encrypted? What other data is being given over?\nAnd why do you have the choice to do that to begin with instead of a more socially\nbeneficial, democratic process\nof determining how we're comfortable with technology entering our lives?","I probably would have even had an even better or even stronger perspective on\nit seems like the governments didn't really attack these corporations.\nThe governments made their business model look bad. So now they needed to change\nsomething to convince people no, no, no, your data is safe here.\nWe'll encrypt something and moving on, moving on.","I was, for the gentle listener, I was kind of joking because that rhetoric around\nbeing attacked and being like, oh my gosh, was Very much the mood at that time.\nI was at Google when Snowden dropped and I remember just things popped off and\nI actually had to get, I got on a plane.\nI don't know, you all probably have a memory similar to me of like when the\nGuardian stories with the Verizon water, like the Glenn Greenwald stories.\nIt was night in New York. It was probably morning the next day you guys saw\nit. I remember sitting on my couch and being like, holy fuck.\nAnd realizing just how big that was because it was the kind of thing we'd been\ntalking about, speculating about in the rooms that you and I were in, Linus.\nAnd then it was like, oh, receipts, shit.\nAnd there was a lot of unclarity. There was that Prism slide where it was like,\nis Google just giving them full access? That people were rioting inside.\nSecurity engineers were threatening to quit.\nAnd then that morning I got on a plane to TorDev.\nAnd so, yeah, in Berlin, actually.","I remember that this time,\nand we at CCC really had to bite our tongue and write a media communications\nstrategy and said, nobody says I told you so.\nWe need to at least act surprised as well, right? And not say,\nwell, we told you all along.","I give you all a pass, because you did tell us all along.","But of course it gave a lot of international media attention to our cause.\nAnd we needed to play that public attention wisely.","Exactly.","I think we maybe did.","I find it quite interesting how encryption as a topic has changed over time. It's just...\nMore or less 10 years ago that Facebook actually changed to HTTPS on their website by default.\nAnd so there was a time not so long ago, you know, where most of the data was\nflowing around on the Internet, mostly unencrypted.\nAnd that although there was these already mentioned crypto wars,\nyou know, about general encryption, but it was also always for nerds and for\nspecific applications.\nThen it also got this nice paint with this whole cryptocurrency craze going\non, which made it somehow popular and almost took the word away.","We're so wrestling.","And it was also the rise of encrypted messaging that was really giving a new fuel.\nSo Signal was in the middle of all of this, as we already heard.\nSo, I'd like to focus on Signal for a moment as an organization that you now head.\nWhat's your understanding of\nwhat Signal is and what it's not and how the organization deals with it?","Well, I love Signal and I'm really...\nYeah, it's the only cool tech company in my view. Und ich denke...\nSo boiling down, like what is Signal in one word is a little,\nyou know, I'll just, I'll start somewhere and we'll end another place because\nI think it's actually, it's a number of things and kind of represents even more.\nYou know, Signal started back, you know, the late 2000s, right?\nAnd we can, you know, we can date it to whenever, right?\nSignal as the integrated app was 2013, but your Red Phone, TextSecure predated that.\nAnd this is, you know, there's no iPhone.\nJabber is the competition, right? It's like web client-based chat.\nThere's no, you know, people aren't carrying smartphones. There isn't,\nWhatsApp doesn't exist.\nIMessage doesn't exist. You have a very, very different marketplace.","Were there still ICQ and AIM, I think, at the time?","Yeah, yeah. I mean, I remember using, like, I don't remember,\nI'd like send text messages sometimes, but they were expensive on my BlackBerry, maybe.\nBut we're talking about a drastically different tech ecosystem.\nAnd this is particularly important in the context of messaging and communications apps.\nBecause, of course, you need a network effect for those to work.\nNo one buys the first telephone because you can't use one telephone.\nYour friend has to have a telephone.\nAll your friends have to have an app if you're going to use it.\nParticularly, it takes two to encrypt. Group encryption, it takes everyone in the group.\nAnd if everyone isn't using your app for communication, it's very different\nin a saturated marketplace where you have WhatsApp,\nwhere you have iMessage, where you have these normative models that people go\nto just to have their regular communication to introduce a new platform.\nFor secure messaging or insecure messaging, right?\nBecause people don't switch outside of the network unless their friends switch\noutside of the network and there's a collective action problem there and an\ninertia problem there and all of that, right?\nSo when I think about, there's many things that are very precious about Signal,\nbut the fact that Moxie carried it on his back for that decade and was actually\nable to keep it going and surviving without selling out,\nwithout selling data and actually creating something that is now able to scale\nto hundreds of millions of people.\nMeans that Signal actually has a position in this ecosystem that makes it useful to people.\nThat means that it's actually providing encrypted communication to people all\nover the globe because their friends are using it.\nAnd my contention here, and I'm willing to discuss this, I don't think we can\nrecreate Signal, right?\nYou could shift, you know, because it has that user base, right?\nYou can introduce a new app, but how do you get people to use it without an\nOEM, without an existing installed user base, without some way of,\nyou know, kind of making it useful to people?\nBecause again, it's, you know, one telephone or, you know, a couple thousand\nhackers who all use PGP, but they can't talk to their dad on PGP, right?\nThey can't talk to anyone outside of themselves on PGP. So Signal has both sort\nof kept this form that is very heterodox in tech.\nIt's a nonprofit, so I couldn't really sell out profitably.\nI could try to sell out, but I'm not going to get any money from it.\nIt has to be reinvested in the mission, and there are certain rules around mission alignment there.\nSo we're not pressured to monetize surveillance or to collect any data.\nWe're really able to stay focused on that mission and in an ecosystem where.\nThe diametric opposite is the norm. That's really, really important,\nirrespective about the flaws of the nonprofit model more generally.\nSo it's achieved this pretty rare, like it's the only thing like it in the ecosystem.\nAnd I think it also serves as a model for how we could think about building tech differently.\nLike, how do we disarm, deconstruct the massive centralized power of a handful\nof platform companies that basically control most of the infrastructure and\ninformation ecosystem in our world and our jurisdiction in the US?\nAnd how do we build other models that may be interoperable, that are more open,\nthat are more rights preserving, and that aren't subject to the pressures of\nand incentives of the surveillance business model?","Now, I find it interesting, you mentioned the network effect that for a long\ntime worked against you, right? You said, okay, it took Moxie a decade.\nNow, that network effect, you know, the EU regulatory bodies have an idea on\nhow to weaken it by enabling messenger interoperability,\nThus, pretty much trying to force the large messenger operators,\nbe it WhatsApp or whatever else people use, to offer an interoperability interface.\nSo any new messenger would have it easier than Signal did to reach the critical,\namount of users to actually have the network effect.\nNow I know Signal's position strongly opposes this idea or you decided not to\nparticipate in this interoperability or making use of it.\nThere are two.\nForces or two goals of Signal, I guess, that contradict each other here,\nand that is its security and building open communication systems.\nMaybe you can explain a little bit why, after, you know, having understood how\nhard it is to build Signal and, you know, against a market, why you would still\noppose messenger interoperability.","Yeah, I like this question because I'm going to, I want to clarify our position,\nwhich is a little bit of nuance.\nI don't oppose interoperability in principle.\nLike if the interoperability mandate of the DSA were, you all have to,\nyou know, interoperability needs to be an option and it has to happen at this rigorous security bar.\nYou have to make sure that you're implementing metadata security, sealed sender.\nBasically, you're adopting the\nsignal privacy and security bar as the conditions for interoperability.\nThat would be really cool, right? And I think that's the issue here.\nI mean, and I want to put an asterisk here for a moment saying,\nlike, there are a lot of other complexities around policy.\nLike, you know, how do you take in a, you know, who deals with a law enforcement request, right?\nEven if you have no data to give them, you can't just ignore that.\nYou know, like, if a user has a complaint, who do they write in?\nIf you're interoperating with a platform for communication that also has a social\nmedia arm, there's a totally different regulatory environment for Telegram or\nWhatsApp with channels than for a signal.\nHow does that sort of work?\nSo I want to say this isn't simple.","It's a whole can of worms.","There's a massive can of worms as the EU often opens. Um, but the,\nyou know, like the conditions of interoperability are actually really,\nyou know, they're really political here. Right.\nSo in order to interoperate with WhatsApp, am I going to be giving signal user data to Meta?\nWell, that would violate the entire premise of what I'm spending my life's energy\ndoing and Signal, right?\nIs Meta going to decide to, you know, cut off the account of one of our users?\nWho gets to decide that, right? Are they, you know, are they collecting,\nyou know, other data because they aren't implementing some of our libraries or whatever?\nAnd so I think, you know, that's where the rubber meets the road.\nAnd we have to have a duty of care to the people who rely on Signal.\nDas heißt, wir sind absolut nicht going zu verabschieden, dass wir wissen,\nwenn wir real sind, dass es eine Frau in der Jäule in den USA ist,\nweil Meta in den Facebook-Messagen hat, zwischen ihr und ihr daughter,\ndie sie überprüfen hat, dass sie sie erhalten,\nin der Stadt von Nebraska, nach dem Dobbs-Dobbs-Dobbs-Dobbs-Dobbs.\nThat's the stakes of this conversation, even when we're talking about the technical\ndetails of interoperability, right?","Dobbs' decision is reverting Roe v. Wade, right?","Yeah.","Okay, so just for some of the listeners that are not that much into the US policy.","Basically outlawing abortion.","Allowing states to outlaw abortion.","Access to life-saving healthcare that more than half the population may need.","So your answer in short is interoperability is fine,\nbut you do not see any path currently being debated that would result in upholding\nthe security promises that Signal has worked long for to be able to make to its user base.","We will continue to advocate for a path that raises that bar,\nmeets or exceeds Signal's bar. And if it succeeds, I'm like,\nyeah, I want to talk about that.\nBut, you know, those are the conditions under which we would interoperate.\nSo we're not, you know, we don't take a stand against it.\nYou know, we just say like, look, these are the complexities and this is,\nyou know, Signal stands with the people who rely on Signal, not with a sort\nof, you know, vision for some muddy middle where we're all interoperating,\nbut we've sort of, you know, sold people out and made them susceptible to,\nyou know, what we describe with Meta.","Do people in the EU understand what you're talking about if you're offering\nthese technical explanations why it's complicated?\nBecause we have the impression that they don't really get it.","Is this mean or median, people?\nI mean, I don't think most people don't understand this at all because they\ngot laundry to do and this isn't their area, right?\nI think some of the politicians I've talked to seem to get it, but it's not...\nIch denke, dass es eine Inertia über das Prozess ist, das bedeutet,\ndass es nicht klar, wie weit diese Punkte haben, die Bedrock zu haben, so zu sprechen.\nIch würde auch, als Amerikaner, ich bin hier, für heute.\nAber ich also habe, ich würde sagen, mein Instinkt auf die Generalentwicklung\nder EU ist nicht was ich, was ich rely auf.","Which brings me to an interesting point because we are actually very interested\nin your view as an American knowing how things work on that continent,\nWhat's your impression of how Europe deals with tech these new technologies\ncoming up and how it impacts society Can you just give me a feeling for how this is to you,\nin a good way, in a bad way, whatever,\nyou feel just to...","One meta-observation, having been here for a bit of duration now, is,\nAnd I've thought this before, but it's interesting to think of Europe as one thing.\nWhen you go to different countries and meet different people and you're like,\nwow, this is not one thing.","I mean, that's the same in the US, right?","It is in the US, yeah. I mean, you know, it's big.","But there is a common theme somehow. I'm just focusing on what you can probably\nmatch to Europe in general. or at least to the kind of discussions you have\non a political level when you face EU institutions.","It's almost, it's split in an interesting way.\nBecause on one part, if you go to kind of the startup ecosystem,\nthe VC ecosystem, like that world, there's a real,\nyou know, there's a lot of smart people and cool people doing cool things.\nAnd there's sometimes a bit of magical thinking that I see, which is really like,\nyou know, if we wish hard enough, if we're able to figure it out,\nwe're going to be able to create competitors to the US incumbents,\nright? And we're going to have our own thing.","Own search engine.","Which often just, you know, sometimes I'm just like, okay, that's a money play, right?\nLike, you get enough in, you know, your Series A, Series B, and then you'll\nget acquired, and no one will do anything with it, or you'll get rich, or whatever.\nYou know, like, you may not necessarily believe that. Like, markets float on Hype.\nSo, okay. But there is this thread where it's almost a willful misunderstanding\nof the reality of incumbent platforms, of the history that accrued that type\nof power to US companies,\nand of the dependencies that Europe and most of the rest of the world have on these companies.\nThe three cloud companies based in the US have 70, 70% of the global market.\nYou have five major social media platforms.","Amazon, Google and Microsoft.","Yeah, AWS, Azure, GCP. And then I think the other percentage are made up by\nUS companies as well. And then there's some Chinese companies.\nAnd then you have five platforms that effectively shape our global information\necosystem, like our perception of reality.\nThe four biggest jurisdictions in the US, right?","Which five platforms?","Das ist, was ich werde, ich werde, ich werde, vier haben, denn da ist immer eine Last in der Liste.\nSo TikTok ist eine Non-U.S. one, und das ist die eine die Leute freigte aus, um, recently.","Weil es ist Non-U.S.?","Ja, ich denke, so flatly, ist es.\nFacebook, Instagram, X.\nUnd dann, es ist nicht Twitch, aber irgendwie, da ist eine andere one auf YouTube.\nUnd dann ist Twitch, too.\nFür all intents und purposes, das ist ein huge amount of concentrated power\nthat, again, relies on network effects, relies on economies of scale,\nrelies on all kinds of global infrastructure.\nIt's trillions of dollars that can't just be interrupted by investment. This is a kind of...","This is social media companies.","Social media and platform companies, right?","And isn't Telegram one of them?","Well, Telegram doesn't, I think, run most of their own infrastructure.\nThey don't have a cloud business model.\nAnd they also don't really have a business model. It seems like they have this crypto play.\nBut it's not clear how that money moves. There's a lot of UAE investment.\nSo you're not talking about these big tech...","Okay, you're focusing on cloud, not so much on the social media aspect.","And what is it difficult? Where is the normative shape of the tech industry coming from, right?\nLike if the cloud companies all of a sudden decided to cut off half their APIs\nand change their infrastructure, there's like most startups in the entire world,\nincluding organizations like Signal, Telegram, whoever's writing on top,\nall their engineers' pagers go off.\nThey got to respond to that, right? It's unidirectional that way.","Right?","If sanctions go up, let's do a wild dictator gets elected in the US and decides\nthat Europe is now sanctioned and that Amazon can't do business with Europe. What happens?","Data in the US, that would never happen.","I make things up as a creative person.\nRemember, I come from literature and rhetoric.","Just stories in your head. Ja.","Und dann sieht man die Social Media Platforms, die wir wissen,\ndass es ein far-right ist,\ndas wirklich hat die Intelligenz und Interessenzierung auf die Alternative Media\nEcosystems über die Plattformen und die Affordanzer von Surveillance-Advertising-Driven\nMedia Plattformen zu schaffen.","Okay, back to the magical thinking of Europe.","Yeah. I'd like to understand how you see.","So in this world.","There are like a few Europeans that say, here's 50 million, let's compete with these guys.","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","And that's probably what the European search engine is.","It's like 500 million dollars European sovereign AI fund.\nAnd then you're like, but that's half a training run. Like, what are you buying with that?\nWhich is like which is disturbing because it's like okay well that's a lot of\nmoney also let's not be flip about it and it could be going to really good things\nit could be supporting you know interesting open projects it could be supporting\nyou know alternative interoperable alternatives are like you know smaller clouds for more,\nheterodox open source project like there's really cool stuff that is languishing\nwithout that money and I think it's where is that money going?\nWell if you're talking about going into AI it's going to one of those three\ncloud companies it's renting infrastructure from Microsoft Amazon or Google\nfor model development or for deployment which is inference and inference is\nreally expensive you don't just train once,\nyou use a model using it is way way more expensive than normal information retrieval\nand so you're also it's just this massive computationally expensive,\nUnd du hast nicht die Europäische Sovereinheit, du hast eine Gefühl, die...\nI don't know, like, not behind, which, like, you know, and feeling of not being\nashamed by being technologically...","But apart from the magical thinking, is there anything else you would stick to in Europe?","And then there's the other side, which is I often find a much more sophisticated\nand clear-eyed view of these problems, right?\nLike, having this discussion about that concentrated power in the hands of infrastructure\nand media ecosystem, way easier in Europe.\nI mean, people feel it, right? They see it. And there's been a history of pushing\nback against the encroachment of US\ntech, both effectively and often very ineffectively, that I really enjoy.\nAnd particularly in Germany, there's a very high sensitivity to privacy,\nvery often clear-eyed view on some of these debates, which doesn't always translate into policy.\nBut there's at least, like I find the intellectual environment around this stuff,\nwhen you talk to people who are knowledgeable and have thought about it,\nto be very, I don't know, to teach me a lot and be really sophisticated.","Yeah, the GDPR is probably a German thing somehow in its core, for sure.\nSo how does this affect the talk to European politicians and how do you see\nthe trends in regulations and trying to apply new laws and regulations towards\nthis whole tech industry?","Ja, ich meine, es gibt beide threads.\nDu hast zwei Wolves inside European Politik.\nDer eine will seine eigene Tech-Industrie und der eine will sie nicht zu machen.\nDas ist nicht zu US-Tech-Colonialismus.\nUnd ich denke, du hast du some weirden Laws.\nDu hast die AI-Act, die aufwärtigte, die aufwärtigte, kind of had this last-minute\nbrinksmanship around whether foundation models.\nThese big LLMs that are now the trendy kind should be included or not.\nAnd you often see bold regulatory attempts that then get kind of shaped in odd\nways, trying to have it both ways, right?\nLike how do we regulate the Americans away and get our own, right?\nBut how do we do that in a way that it is reflected in principles,\nnot in actually declaring that as an intent.\nAnd I think that is, I think you're seeing a huge amount of money be spent by\nthe US companies in Brussels right now, which is also influencing things in interesting ways.\nAnd then this is something I'm theorizing a lot in my intellectual work,\nor just, and I think is really important.\nYou also see what I'm calling the politics of intellectual shame.\nBe really pervasive in this conversation and this is not just Europe this is across the board.\nI mean that there is a real.\nA real fear among a lot of people who are in decision-making positions,\npoliticians or academics or whoever,\nand not even in decision-making positions, but it matters when it's them,\nof being stupid about tech,\nof being behind the ball on tech.\nAnd this plays right into patriarchal dynamics.\nMen hate when someone else knows something more than them, in particular if that's a small woman.","I think we enjoy it right now.","Ja, ja, ja. Totally.","Wir haben eine gute Zeit.","Ja. Well, you all are, generally, and I don't want to gender this in such a\nschematic, but there is an ego that can be very, very fragile here.\nAnd the way I've put it before is it kind of turns uncertain men into yes men.\nLike, they don't want to ask the dumb question. They don't want to be like,\nwhat's an LLM? What's a server? Like, how does that work?\nAnd that type of insecurity, The fear of being behind, the fear of being called\ntechnically unsophisticated or hampering progress or putting your finger on\nthe scales of science, look the Nobels, how could you stand in the way of all this progress?\nI think really gives the upper hand to the companies and those who have an interest\nin creating products and growth and domination via these technologies.\nBecause people really don't want to challenge them because challenging their\ndominance or their plans gets conflated with somehow being anti-science or being\nstupid about tech or not being smart enough to have a position on a topic.\nAnd I think that's something because I kind of came up through Google asking\nevery dumb question in the book because I had no I didn't come from that world.\nRight. So I had to ask, like, how does a computer work? Right.\nI'm like, I'm like, can someone diagram what a function is? I don't know any of this stuff. Right.\nBut I kind of I think I have a sensitivity to that because I also I remember feeling it.\nI remember people being mean about it. Like if I didn't, you know,\nlike back in the day when I was trying to learn this stuff.\nAnd I think that, you know, a discourse that collapses scientific progress into kind of.\nThe success of a handful of tech companies preys on that type of insecurity\nand has created an environment in which people have no idea what AI is and are\nstill professing boldly on how to regulate it.","So I read it as you think that the European positions might be slightly under-informed\nand probably not well thought out in the current situation.","I should be clear. I don't think that what I was describing and the politics\nof intellectual shame are not unique to Europe, but I think are in Europe as well.\nAnd particularly folks who feel like, you know, the Americans beat us, we got to get ahead.\nRight. I think where I see the European position being most, let's say,\nunder-informed or perhaps just in some cases pernicious is in the chat controls\nregulation and the desire,\nthe apex of magical thinking, Which is, you know, let's rename a backdoor client-side\nscanning and then let's mandate scanning everyone's private messages,\ncomparing what's in those messages against some database of permissible or impermissible\ncontent and then, you know, taking action on those, you know,\nin the name of protecting children,\nwhich is the justification during this instantiation of the crypto wars.","Let's stick to this topic, because it's still an ongoing battle right now.\nWe are more or less talking about this in every of our shows.\nAnd yeah, it's still totally unclear what's going to come out of this.\nHow do you see this discussion evolve?","Well, I don't, you know, I see this as an ongoing power struggle, right?\nBetween who? Well, between, like this is not a misunderstanding.\nI think a lot of the people pushing for this understand that backdoors are dangerous\nand understand that, you know, the pretext is flimsy, but that, you know.\nAsymmetric power constitutes itself in part through information asymmetry.\nAnd there's a deep discomfort that dates back to 1976 when Diffie Hellman were\ntrying to publish their paper introducing public cryptography and the U.S.\nGovernment was trying to suppress it, trying to say, don't publish this, right?\nAnd then, you know, but databases weren't quite big enough, networks weren't\nquite big enough or ubiquitous enough for it to matter, matter.\nBut they were already looking at like, oh, shit, we don't want this in the public,\nright? And then you go through the 90s and there's the Clipper chip and key\nescrow and you have Stuart Baker writing in Wired magazine, like PGP is just\nfor terrorists. We have proof.\nNo, PGP is for pedophiles, right? Which really echoes what we're hearing now.\nRight? Like who even has a computer in 1994, I believe, when this op-ed is written?\nAnd then we have Post 9-11 and then it's like, actually, PGP is for terrorists, right?\nAnd encryption is for terrorists. All the while, our dependency on digital infrastructures\nfor communications is growing and growing and growing.\nOur dependency on digital infrastructures generally is growing.\nAnd the need for encryption to protect commerce becomes existential to the Internet industry.\nAnd then what do you do about communications, right? And I think this has been\nan anxiety that is pervasive among those who, you know, law enforcement,\ngovernments, whoever, who feel that they need to constitute their power via\ninformation asymmetry.\nAnd any encryption that protects people, not just commerce, is a threat to that, right?\nAnd so what I don't see is that we're going to win an argument,\nright, or that we're going to win this via strength of argument.\nI do think we can fight and we, you know, I think, I think we're in a position\nnow where we're seeing, we're seeing chat controls, you know,\nI believe Hungary just tried to raise it and didn't get the support.\nThere was the Belgian proposal a few months ago, also didn't get the support at the last minute.\nAnd we just had the Dutch law enforcement authorities writing a memo to the\ngovernment there saying, yo, don't support this.\nYou're talking about a very dangerous backdoor that would undermine Dutch cybersecurity,\nright? At the same time, we have reporting in the Wall Street Journal...\nEs gibt einen Receit für was, was all of us should have suspected all along,\nist, dass die Backdoors, die in den US-Telecommunications Infrastruktur,\nfür Government Intercept, haben wir von China-Intelligence und vielleicht anderen.\nIch denke, an dieser Moment, wir haben ein vieles...\nDie Facts sind auf unserer Seite, und die Facts sind auf der Seite,\nist permeatet in diese Diskussion, and making it harder and harder for them\nto push it forward in the European Commission.","But that usually means they just do another attempt next year.","Exactly. And that's why I think we're not going to win. There's going to be\nanother pretext if we win this one, right?\nThere's going to be another angle if we win this one.\nWe just have to keep building our muscle to sustain this fight probably forever,\nbecause I don't think the will to power is going away.\nI think they're just going to keep trying to rearrange the reasoning.","Aber wie geht es? Wenn Sie sagen, dass die Strecke der Argument nicht genug ist, ist es nicht genug?","Ich mache Yoga every day.","Does es helfen?","Ich meine, yes, es hilft.","Ich meine, in terms of politische Diskussionen.","In terms of politische Diskussionen, es hilft, dass wir richtig sind.\nWe bring in, there's a huge amount of evidence that a lot of people haven't\nseen in these political discussions.\nI think we're on the, our side has been on the back foot for a while.\nThere has been just in civil society, there's been cutting funding to privacy\nadvocacy has happened since around, there's a sort of a history here.\nI think there's a move toward tech accountability happened after the 2016 election.\nThere's the Cambridge Analytica scandal. There's all of this.\nAnd it's like, okay, we need to hold tech accountable.\nAnd then there are a number of – the way to hold tech accountable is to attack\nthe business model, is my view.\nBut there aren't that many pieces of legislation or proposals that actually do that.\nMany of them sort of use the wrapping and the language of accountability.\nBut are actually just expanding surveillance, right?\nIt's like, we're going to hold them accountable, so we need a database,\nso we need to know who's logging into websites so we can find the bad guy.\nWe need to know what's in your messaging so that we can make sure that these\ntech companies aren't allowing crime on their platforms, et cetera, et cetera.\nSo it was basically a hijacking of this, in many cases, kind of righteous moment\nwhere people recognize that this business model was pretty harmful,\nto fulfill the wishes that have been pervasive since well before then.\nAt the same time that we're seeing privacy advocacy and a lot of those,\nyou know, a lot of the things Linus, you and I had been doing for a long time,\nreceiving less and less support and sort of, you know, out of the limelight.\nAnd so I think it was in that environment that things like chat controls,\nthat things like the online safety bill and other, you know,\nparadigmatic examples of this, you client-side scanning to save children meme,\ngrew up and then one of the reasons I was,\nThere are many, many reasons I\ndecided to move from being on the board of Signal to full-time at Signal.\nOne of them was that I saw this moment and I realized there weren't that many\npeople fighting it and that one of the things that I could bring was a staunch\nwillingness to fight it.","And how do you do that? I mean, can you walk us through a day?","I open up my laptop. Ja, um, um, well, we, you know, it's not,\nobviously, it's not just me, nothing like this is a singular thing.\nWe work with a pretty broad coalition of folks. I'm sure, you know,\nmany of your friends, many listeners, perhaps, are part of that.\nUm, Signal doesn't have a policy arm. It's a very kind of lean,\ntargeted, pretty senior organization.\nBut we do work with people around the globe EDRI and the EU a number of other\norganizations to keep tabs on what's happening we also are in a good position.\nWe're a non-profit we are very committed to rigorous communication so we don't\nhave a history of hyper-marketing we don't do hyper-marketing now and so we're\nvery careful when we make a claim When we make a statement,\nwe're backing that with citations. It's accurate.\nWe're really marshalling the technical knowledge and prowess that we have.\nI almost think of it as clarifying the record. If there's a report that says\nclient-side scanning is actually safe, we know it's not safe.\nOkay, well, there's an academic coalition that has written this letter.\nSignal can write a letter. We can begin to put a bit more weight on the scales\nthat have been fairly light, given the dynamics I just outlined.\nAnd then I do media, I do public speaking.\nI think a lot about how to tell this story in a way that isn't boring or alienating\nfor regular people, particularly because the story on the other side is so arresting.\nIt's like we have to save children from abuse.\nAnd that every one of us it like hits you in the heart, right?\nLike myself, right? Like my amygdala is activated.\nI, you know, suddenly I just want to do something. I want to help,\nyou know, give me the thing to do. How do we do that, right?\nAnd then sitting across from that and being like, well, let me tell you about\na one-way function, right? Like you can't, that's not.\nThat's not going to work, right? And so like, how do you,\nHow do you enter into that debate in a way that isn't dismissing the very grim\nand real problem that is being evoked and make it clear that the solution to\nthat problem that is being presented will not solve that problem, one,\nand two, will cause drastically worse problems for many people around the world?\nAnd that's the task at hand right now.","So basically the discussion is\nled by pointing the other side to like the infeasibility of the approach.","Well, the infeasibility, the danger of the approach,\na lot of evidence around the infeasibility of the approach that is either kind\nof willfully ignored or just not understood,\nand then figuring out how we explain that without being either accidentally\nor genuinely callous about the concerns that have brought people to the table.","Then they will say, but we have to do something.","Well, how about funding social services?\nHow about, you know, what do you do? And I mean, like, if we're going to go\nthere, we're going to go there.\nPrince Andrew's walking around.","No, you're suggesting to make the world better.","Jimmy Savile's walking around. You know, like what are the infrastructures in\nplace to make sure that when children are going through this,\nthey're believed, they're protected.\nYou know, what happens when it's your priest? What happens when it's your teacher?\nWhat happens when it's your brother, right? Like these are the questions that\nare really hard to look in the face because they implicate social pathologies\nand interpersonal relationships and power dynamics that are really,\nreally difficult and often relate to emotionally challenging factors outside\nof that or people's past experiences or what have you.\nSo you're going right into very traumatic subjects.\nBut I don't think we can have that conversation without having a real conversation.\nAnd then when you begin to pull back the layers there, you say,\noh, well, the UK has been pushing for client-side scanning as a remediation to child abuse.\nBut the UK government in 2023 funded social services at 7% of the amount recommended.\nRight? So like there's, you know, the roofs on the schools in the UKs are collapsing.\nLike, you know, there isn't support for this.\nAnd then if you, you know, if you look at, and I don't have public numbers to\nshare, but I've had a number of personal conversations.\nOkay, well, how many law enforcement people, how many people are tasked with\nactually sort of pursuing the,\nyou know, like the criminality that may be reported via online imagery?\nIn some cases, it's two. In one case, it's two in one country. Two people, right?\nSo, like, you're not actually, like, if you begin to map this,\nwhat you see is a story that does not add up.\nAnd you see, like, what, you know, and this is where I get enraged.\nBecause I'm like, you are fucking trading...\nOn children's pain, to get your backdoor, whatever the fuck you want,\npretending that you're solving it, so taking up the space for actual solutions\nthat could actually help real children who are suffering now,\nand turning no attention to every glaring problem in this massive list,\nwhich is pretty obvious, even for me, and I'm not an expert here,\nI've just sort of sifted through this.\nSo I think that's the dynamic we're walking into.","They might only have two people, but at some point in time they might have doubled,\nby adding another one.","I agree that, I mean, it is quite telling how much emphasis is being laid on,\nhey, we really need client-side scanning and then the world is going to be safe.\nAnd, you know, if you say, well, how about we, you know, we fund support or\nany kind of prevention, preventive activities in um social care it's like yeah.","Yeah yeah well sorry we use the prefix online so that's not our,\num and i think it's also like there's something people gravitate to the abstraction\nright if this is online child abuse then we don't have to deal with it in our\nreal lives it becomes an abstraction that we can almost blame on the same platforms\nthat have been so unaccountable we can blame it as an internet phenomenon, not a phenomenon.\nAnd like, oh wait, our church doesn't have the infrastructure to actually deal\nwith this in a humane way, right? And I think that's a dynamic that we're also seeing here.","This is, by the way, one thing I find so interesting about Signal as a secure messenger.\nWell, it has become mainstream, but it has also managed to maintain a reputation\nof goodness, right? I mean, saying like, okay, text me on signals.\nOh yeah, that's the secure messenger, blue symbol, looks nice,\nyou know, very friendly user interface.\nOr it would be like, let's text on 3MAR, be like, oh, that's the complicated black one.\nWell, how about Telegram? And that's like, okay, that's a completely different end of the internet.\nAnd that makes me think of the curious case of Pavel Durov being detained in\nFrance and apparently at least charged because they refused to cooperate in numerous cases.\nWhy do you dare to come to Europe, Meredith?","Well, I'm a brave person, Linus. Aber, zu sagen, ich denke,\nThis is one of the places where more public education is necessary because Telegram\nis actually, you said the other end of the internet, it is very,\nvery, very different from Signal.\nSo Telegram is a social media platform. It allows mass broadcasts to millions\nof people. You can go viral on Telegram.\nYou can find strangers on Telegram via directories.\nThere's a near-me feature that will geolocate things happening near you,\nall sorts of things that are not private, are not secure,\nare regulated completely differently from private and secure communications\nlike Signal, which is solely a private and secure interpersonal communications app.","What about Signal Stories, though?","Signal Stories don't go viral. If I sent all the people in my contact list one\nby one a photo or something...","I don't get your stories.","They're so cute, Linus. I wish, like, it's, you know.","I hate it.","I mean, that feature was implemented. I was like, okay, where can I turn it off?","I'm sorry. Well, you're all missing my stories is all I'm saying,\nand they are pretty good.","Have you sent us some? No.","Well, have you activated them to check? But we do let you deactivate them forever\nand never bother you about them, which is, you know, part of the way that I\nthink we maintain our reputation for not being shitty is we try to literally not be shitty.","Yeah, thanks.","Right? And when we're designing Signal, we're actually very,\nvery careful not to be a social media platform.\nWe think about that in the design phase so everything we do can be as encrypted as possible.\nSo that we don't know anything about you or as close to zero about the people\nwho use Signal as possible.\nAnd what we do know is we can say, yes, this phone number did sign up for a\nSignal account. We know when that phone number signed up for a signal count\nand we know last time they accessed it.\nUm, but we don't, you know, we, we would like to even not know that if it were possible.\nOn the other hand, Telegram is a social media platform, which retains huge amounts of data,\nhas a duty to under law to cooperate in turning over that data and was search\nfunctions that has search functions, has, you know, directories so you can find new things.\nSo it's a, it's a very different beast. And I think, one, because Durov has, you know, been very.\nI'm trying for a diplomatic word, like, has made statements that are not supported\nby fact around Telegram being private and secure and kind of taken on this,\nyou know, like yeoman's defender of free speech and privacy position.\nPeople often think Telegram is private and secure because it has a DMs feature, right?\nBut, you know, Signal is just private and secure. So the TLDR on that is,\nthere's really no danger for Signal here because we are very,\nvery far away from Telegram.\nAnd we have set ourselves up so that one, such cooperation isn't required.\nAnd two, such cooperation is not possible.\nBecause we literally, like you could put a gun to my head, I don't have that\ndata. Whereas Telegram has servers and servers and servers full of that data.","Leaving out Signal completely now, what do you think happened?\nPawelldorf was put into custody. He's now free on bail.\nAnd France talked to him.","I have no idea. I mean, this is like...","Didn't he send you like a telegram message?","I haven't checked.","You missed his story.","Yeah.","I mean, this is like overlaid the French legal system.\nI am not a lawyer, especially not in France. Some of the vagaries of their legal\nsystem in which, you know,\nany judge can open an investigation and the basis for the charges will not be\nknown until, you know, trial.\nAnd we're looking at years and years until then, with me not speaking French\nwell at all with like weird translation, you know, like, so I want to stay away\nfrom speculating there.\nBut what it looks like based on the charges that were released in the press\nrelease is that it was, you know, failure to comply with requests for data and\nthen, you know, kind of a handful of other charges added on that aren't as severe as those.","So does Signal get these requests too?","You can go to Signal.org slash Big Brother and every request that we have been\nforced to comply with because we fight them and have unsealed are posted there\nshowing exactly how close to no data we are able to turn over and showing,\nand I think this is interesting for some of your listeners probably,\nYou see what the law enforcement agencies in these requests are requesting,\nand it's often huge lists,\nmassive amounts of data, which gives you a sense of just how much data surveillance,\nlike a telegram or another platform,\nis commonly able to provide that Signal is not.","Oh, so it's actually every single request. I thought it would maybe be aggregated.","Yeah, no, it's PDFs of the request. It's not a transparency report, it's transparency.","I like that.","Although it's just the ones that we can unseal, so we do have to go through that.","I would assume there are probably some with gag orders, right? be able to say?","There's no gag order on me being able to say.\nAnd there are some, but that's the fight to unseal it. And what I don't recall\nthe answer for right now is whether we're in one of those fights right now or not.\nBut I'd have to check with my friends at the ACLU.","So Signal as a company, how does it work?","It's a non-profit. So we're funded by donations only\nonly yeah um and we\nare thinking about in the future maybe having a\npaid tier for some features something like backups encrypted\nbackups which we're you know building right now um you know could we charge\npeople for media storage or other expensive features but um you know that would\nbe in addition to donations and squarely within the non-profit structure that\nkeeps us safe from pressure to surveil.","And how do you get your talent? How do you get people to work for Signal?","We pay very well. And we are, I mean, it's a really cool mission, right?\nSo imagine the jobs in tech are kind of depressing in many cases.\nNot everyone wants to go optimize an ad server and then Signal,\nyou know, Signal you can work for core infrastructure for dissent and human\nrights work and journalism around the world that, you know, without which a\nlot of those things would be deeply imperiled.\nLike it's a real cool thing to get to do and support. And we pay well.","So not only do you get respected for your six-digit salary, but for doing good\nthing, earning that money.","Es ist die original Silicon Valley dream.","So ist es der letzte Platz in tech where people are actually happy?","Well, I would never presume to speak to the consciousness of another person without there.\nBut I think, yeah, I am very happy. I think a lot of the people who are at Signal are very happy.\nAnd I think it's also like we're kind of part of a project. And this is...\nShows that what we have in tech, what's built in the tech industry is not inevitable.\nThere's a series of choices, a series of incentives, a business model that has\nshaped tech into the form we have now, but it does not have to be that way, right?\nLike we can rewrite the stack, we can build alternatives.\nNonprofits can work, right? We need capital, we need will, we need talent,\nwe need all of those things.\nBut the thing we have now is not inevitable. And I think of Signal as like a\nkeystone species in the ecosystem, Kind of like, you know, like setting the\nbar, kind of regulating the rest, right? Like, you know, you can have privacy.\nYou can have, you know, the right to private communications.\nYou can subsist outside of this paradigm.\nAnd I think the future I want is that it's not just Signal, right?\nThere are many, many other organizations and efforts sort of doing it differently,\nrejecting that paradigm, you know, drawing in capital there and,\nyou know, away from the other place.\nUnd beginnt zu marscheln die type of political will that is often very shallow\nlike the 500 million AI fund but marscheln it for something that is actually\nsubstantive and is actually,\nmaking the kind of change to the tech ecosystem that I think we need to have a livable world.","You mean not only a model for other communication companies but also a model\nfor any kind of technology company?","Ja, well, I mean, we build a communications app, but we rely on telecom networks.\nWe rely on server infrastructure. We rely on core libraries.","That's not what I meant. I mean, I understood you that you think that the modus\noperandi of Signal as a company might be something that other companies could also leverage and do.\nIt's not only limited to some much-needed device.","I do think that there's a model there. I think I'm interested right now in researching\nhybrid structures and tandem structures.\nAre there sort of for-profit,\nAre there areas of tech that aren't driven by surveillance?\nAre there ways you could fund nonprofits, fund some of this core infrastructure,\nlibraries and other things that have been languishing for decades?\nHow do you revitalize that? And then are there, you know, are there ways to\nbuild truly independent infrastructure outside of the, you know,\nthree companies, five platforms model that, like, I think it's just clearly\ncritically dangerous at this point.","So, when it's about building infrastructures in our hands, that's not going\nto be easier in an AI world, right?\nWhere it's model data that we need, huge investments into these models just\nfor training, then for operating them.\nDo you see any future for this whole AI thing in users' hands,\nin our hands, serving our actual privacy needs and let's say private and business needs?","Well, I think my answer to that is that that future will rely on laying an independent\ninfrastructural bedrock and actually transforming some of the way we govern\nand think about digital technology generally,\nIncluding being really attentive to things like how is data created?\nWho gets to decide what data we use to reflect our complex lives and realities?\nWho gets to decide how patterns in that data are made sense of?\nWhat analysis is done to that data? And then what we do with the sense we make\nof it, right? What decisions we make, right? And so...\nWe do all that, we transform what AI is and what it means.\nBecause you're no longer just scraping all the detritus off the stupid web,\nwhich was deposited or created via this surveillance business model,\npackaging that in an LLM and calling that intelligence, right?\nYou're actually having to grapple with the epistemic process by which data becomes\na proxy for reality, and that proxy shapes our lives and institutions.\nAnd so I think AI itself, right now we're talking about these massive models, right?\nThis laws of scale, this sort of like big American guy dream of the,\nyou know, the largest in the world.\nBut AI is a, you know, it's a very slippery term. It's not a technical term\nof art. It can apply to many, many different things. And there are small models.\nThere are sort of, you know, heterodox approaches. There are expert systems,\nwhich they're now trying to bolt onto the side of generative systems.\nBecause weight, probabilistic answers aren't true, so we need to bolt truth\nback on and we're kind of repeating a lot of the history of AI,\nkind of speedrunning it in the search for a business model.\nSo my answer there is that a lot of the things that need to be done to simply\ndisarm and draw down the centralized power of these surveillance and infrastructure companies\nare the same things that would need to be done to redefine, in a sense,\nwhat AI is and our relationship to how truth, how, you know,\ndecisions, how, you know, I don't want to use the word truth actually,\nbut like how information is made via analyzing data and who gets to control that.\nAnd I think, you know, my sensitivity to data in that answer comes directly\nfrom my measurement experience, right?\nLike where you, you know, one upgrade to the Linux kernel across our server\nfleet fundamentally changed.\nThe kind of data we were able to create, like how it populated the schema.\nAnd meant that that data wasn't necessarily fungible with the data collected\non the older version of the kernel, right?\nAnd in order to solve that problem, I had to get a guy to go sit with the kernel\nmaintainers for like two years to make sure that the update wasn't going to\nfuck up the way we got TCB DOMS, basically.\nUm so like that you know that's and\nthat's that's then think about social\ndata then think about data that reflects like who gets\naccess to resources then think about all of the other things and um\ni think i think it's actually an exciting idea to think on like you know how\ndo we how do we create systems where we're much more attentive to that and recognize\nthat there is a you know it really matters how those choices are made how those\nyou know how data is created who gets a und wie es zu sagen ist, und wie es zu sagen ist.","Would you say in that future, so there is these large gen AI models and whatnot,\nand from other discussions we've had, I know that you probably believe there\nis a stronger future for specialized models, expert models, not the generative ones.\nWould that be a prediction of how this whole AI thing is going to evolve?\nNot from the business model perspective or from the political perspective but\nfrom the actual technology and research perspective.\nDo you think there is still going to be exponential improvement in the Gen AI\nworld or do you think it's now the time for the smaller speedboats?","Well, I think it's definitely time for smaller speedboats and I want to index\non that word improvement because if we scratch the surface on some of these large models,\nsome of which are generative you begin to realize that a lot of the claims to\nimprovement and accuracy are based on really narrow benchmarks and evaluations\nthat don't reflect the performance of these models That's.","How Germans optimize their diesel engines.","Exactly So it's there\nare things that Gen AI models can do I don't see them realistically going away\nBut I do see the struggle for a market fit that can produce the kinds of returns\nnecessary to prop up a massively energy intensive,\nmassively infrastructurally intensive, extraordinarily capital intensive industry, right?\nSo you have billions of dollars for a training run, just huge amounts of energy\nand effort needed to create a model.\nBut okay, who's going to keep paying for a chatbot that's wrong?\nAnd so I think there is a struggle for market fit.\nI think you see this with things like Microsoft Recall where they pushed to\nimplement this. I don't know.\nMicrosoft Recall was supposed to ship with Windows 11.","Es ist aber nicht auf der Default.","Ja, wir haben das kleine Sache. Aber es ist ein AI-System, whose value proposition\nist, dass es will remember everything you were doing on your device for the last N months.","Das ist ein nice value proposition.","Ich weiß, value to your boss, maybe. Und so you can type, oh,\nich will find this browser, ich will find this thing, und es will...\nI get it for you. I obviously don't use it. And how does it remember is really the key here.\nIt remembers because it's taking screenshots of your device every five seconds,\ncreating a library of those screenshots and accessing those as the data on which\nit is able to claim intelligent memory.","That is not an efficient way to approach the problem.","And I don't need to know that I was doomscrolling. Like, you know,\nthat's not a proud moment of memory for me.\nSo, yeah, I mean, and to me what that says, like, that's not a very useful purpose.\nIt's probably going to be marketed to enterprises for, you know,\nworker surveillance is my guess.\nBut it shows that Microsoft is really trying to find a market for this, right?\nBecause they clearly circumvented their QA process.\nThey clearly circumvented their security evaluation. There was a lot of things\nthat clearly didn't happen and didn't happen at a company that is actively...\nDie haben OpenAI, sie investieren eine große Menge in Azure,\nsie sind in der Infrastruktur überall, all of sie sind.\nAber Microsoft ist joked zu OpenAI, so sie hat die Leader Position für ein Moment.\nUnd ich denke, also, dass Microsoft\nist wirklich zu regieren eine gute Reputation in der Security-World,\nes ist indicative of how desperate but that rush to market fit and the AI exceptionalism\nthat is driving it is that they just mess that up so egregiously.\nAnd I can hear some hacker in a Microsoft hallway being like,\nI don't fucking know. I just left that meeting.\nBecause you can kind of sense how those things happen.","What would you say is the dividing line right now between useful applications\nfor machine learning, expert systems, AI stuff, and the hype?","Well, I mean, the question to dig into is useful to whom?\nBecause hype is useful to investors, right? You know, yada yada.","I'm not talking about, yes.","I mean, I think AI is...","In a computer science-y way. I mean, really like making applications possible\nthat haven't been before, that actually do useful stuff to people or society.","Yeah, I mean, one use I think about a lot that is definitely,\nI'm sure, useful to intelligence services is, you know, I'm sure we all assume\nthat POTS telephony data is being collected en masse by every intelligence service,\nwho can and has been for many, many, many years,\nand that data was probably not that useful for a long time because,\nyou know, you're going to have to know, you're going to have to have a human\nreview it or, you know, something like,\nIt's probably a lot more useful now that you can quickly transcribe that with\nAI and sort of synthesize and search using these generative systems, right?\nSo that's one example where I think it's probably almost certainly very,\nvery useful and changes the calculus on like how dangerous this surveillance\nbusiness model is as well.\nBut who is that useful to? It's not me and you.","Yeah, you're going right into surveillance capitalism again.","No, well, that's my, I'm really good at making that turn.","I'm looking for a rosy outlook into the future, like hope.","Yeah, well, I mean.","Anything in store?","I refuse to plant my hope in delusion.","Okay, thanks, thanks.","And I am probably one of the more optimistic people you'll meet.","All right.","Meredith, it was a pleasure.","So fun. Always so fun. Thank you for having me. It's been a really,\nreally delightful conversation with you all.","All right. Thank you. Thanks for listening and see you next week. Goodbye.","Bye-bye."]}
